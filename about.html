        👩🏻‍💻 I am a brazilian web developer that loves new challenges. Raised and
        born in Recife, Brazil. As a south american, I love good food and music.
        I also love watching movies and history. Could spend hours watching a
        very good documentary or horror cinema.

        Today, I live in Omagh, the county town of County Tyrone, Northern
        Ireland. It is situated where the rivers Drumragh and Camowen meet to
        form the Strule.
